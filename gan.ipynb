    "# Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of algorithms used in unsupervised learning - you don't need labels for your dataset in order to train a GAN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GAN framework is composed of two neural networks: a Generator network and a Discriminator network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generator's job is to take a set of random numbers and produce the data (such as images or text).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Discriminator then takes in that data as well as samples of that data from a dataset and tries to determine if it is \"fake\" (created by the Generator network) or \"real\" (from the original dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, the two networks play a game against each other. The Generator tries to create realistic data, so that it can fool the Discriminator into thinking that the data it generated is from the original dataset. At the same time, the Discriminator tries to not be fooled - it learns to become better at determining if data is real or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the two networks are fighting in this game, they can be seen as as adversaries, which is where the term \"Generative Adversarial Network\" comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial takes a look at Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN), which combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and GANs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a DCGAN that is able to create images of handwritten digits from random numbers. The tutorial uses the neural net architecture and guidelines outlined in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434), and the MNIST dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use This Tutorial\n",
    "You can use this tutorial by executing each snippet of python code in order as it appears in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first net is the \"Generator\" and creates images of handwritten digits from random numbers.\n",
    "2. The second net is the \"Discriminator\" and determines if the image created by the Generator is real (a realistic looking image of handwritten digits) or fake (an image that does not look like it is from the original dataset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from creating a DCGAN, you'll also learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to manipulate and iterate through batches of image data that you can feed into your neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create a custom MXNet data iterator that generates random numbers from a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to create a custom training process in MXNet, using lower level functions from the MXNet Module API such as .bind() .forward() and .backward(). The training process for a DCGAN is more complex than many other neural networks, so we need to use these functions instead of using the higher level .fit() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to visualize images as they are going through the training process\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the concepts of CNNs and have implemented one in MXNet. You should also be familiar with the concept of logistic regression. Having a basic understanding of MXNet data iterators helps, since we will create a custom data iterator to iterate though random numbers as inputs to the Generator network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example is designed to be trained on a single GPU. Training this network on CPU can be slow, so it's recommended that you use a GPU for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this tutorial, you need:\n",
    "\n",
    "- MXNet\n",
    "- Python, and the following libraries for Python:\n",
    "    - Numpy - for matrix math\n",
    "    - OpenCV - for image manipulation\n",
    "    - Matplotlib - to visualize the output\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "We need two pieces of data to train the DCGAN:\n",
    "    1. Images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset\n",
    "    2. Random numbers from a normal distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The Generator network will use the random numbers as the input to produce the images of handwritten digits, and the Discriminator network will use images of handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset to determine if images produced by the Generator are realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. Each image is 28x28 pixels in size. To create random numbers, we're going to create a custom MXNet data iterator, which will returns random numbers from a normal distribution as we need then.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prepare the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Preparing the MNSIT dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start by preparing the handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. "

We also reduce by half the number of filters at each layer, reducing dimensionality at each layer. Ultimately, the output layer is a 64x64x3 layer, representing the size and channels of the image. We use tanh activation instead of relu on the last layer, as recommended by the research on DCGANs. The output of neurons in the final gout layer represent the pixels of generated image.\n",

By default, CuDNN requires that this number is greater than 1e-5, so we add a small number to this value, ensuring this values stays small.\n",
